<h1> JOSHUA MENSAH Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2> First, the basics. </h2>

<p>You need the following to build your website. And other web development frameworks </p>

<ul>
    
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>

</ul>

<p> You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.</p>

<ol>

    <li> The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill - Lauryn Hill</li>
    <li> Melodrama - Lorde </li>
    <li> Blonde - Frank Ocean</li>
    <li> Juno - Remi Wolf </li>
    <li> Room for Squares - John Mayer </li>

</ol>

<h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong> strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong> do both. </strong> </em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements </h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. </br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines. </br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h2> Images</h2> 

<p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt = "an image of mochi in a bubble" />
<img src='images/mochi.png' alt = "an plain image of mochi" />
<img src='images/mochi.svg' alt = "small image of mochi with size changers" />
<img src='images/mochi.gif' alt = "a gif of mochi bouncing" />
